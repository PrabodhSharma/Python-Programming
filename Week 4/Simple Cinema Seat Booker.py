# Initialize the seating arrangement
seats = [[False] * 5 for _ in range(3)]                                     # initializes a nested list called seats. [[False] * 5 for _ in range(3)] creates a list with 3 sub-lists (representing rows). Each sub-list contains 5 False values (representing seats). 'False' indicates that the seat is not booked.
